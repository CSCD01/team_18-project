Comments:

I was happy to see that the team is on the same page and collaborating
well. I suggest you put more effort into preparing for the second
interview, so that it looks and sounds more professional.

The team introduction was done well. I suggest that you focus more on
the profesisonal aspects of the team and the team's strenghts for the
second interview.

The project was introduced well, including a good demonstration.

The reasons for selecting the project were presented well.

As we have discussed, there are details missing in the software
process. I would be happy to replace this part of the interview grade
with what you achieve in the second interview.
